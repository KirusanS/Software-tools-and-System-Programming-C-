**An image database created using struct and pointers **

A simple image database used to store images. It will also allow the users to query contents to find all images that have particular attributes. 

Precisely, the database will keep track of three different attributes for each image: its predominant colour, shape and texture. The database will support three different functions:



*   The user can add new images to the database by specifying the file name and the values for the three attributes.
*   The user can query the database by specifying the values for the three attributes and the database will return the names of all image files that match these attributes.
*   The user can ask to have the database contents printed to the screen (i.e. the names of all files stored in the database together with their attributes).
